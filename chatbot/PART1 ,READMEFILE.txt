PART1 ,READMEFILE

This project is a simple console-based chatbot application written in C#.  designed to interact with users and provide meaningful responses about cybersecurity topics like passwords, phishing, and safe browsing. The chatbot is organized into a main class and three subclasses, each handling specific functionalities like ASCII art, voice greetings, and conversational responses.

Main Components
1. Main Class (Program)
The Program class is the entry point of the application. Its purpose is to initialize the chatbot and its related functionalities. It creates instances of the following classes:

ascii_image: Displays a visual representation (ASCII art).

voice_greeting: Plays an audio greeting when the chatbot starts.

chat_responder: Handles user interactions and provides responses.

2. Subclasses
a) ascii_image
Converts an image (lock.jpg) into ASCII art and displays it in the console.

Steps:

Retrieves the file path of the image and loads it using Bitmap.

Resizes the image to a smaller scale for ASCII conversion.

Loops through each pixel, converts its brightness into characters (#, @, ), and prints the result.

b) voice_greeting
Plays an audio file (voicegreet.wav) as a greeting.

Steps:

Locates the audio file by modifying the project directory path.

Uses SoundPlayer to load and play the audio synchronously.

Handles errors gracefully if the file is missing or cannot be played.

c) chat_responder
The core chatbot functionality:

Welcomes the user and asks for their name.

Allows the user to ask cybersecurity-related questions.

Responds dynamically based on keywords like "password," "phishing," or "safe browsing."

Steps:

Stores predefined replies in an ArrayList.

Matches keywords in the user's query to provide relevant responses.

Asks for feedback after answering, allowing the user to ask more questions or provide improvement suggestions.

Usage
Run the Program:

Start the application to initialize the chatbot and its features.

ASCII Art:

Upon startup, the chatbot generates and displays ASCII art from an image.

Voice Greeting:

Plays a short greeting audio file at the beginning.

Chatbot Interaction:

Chat with the bot by typing queries related to cybersecurity.

Type exit to end the conversation.

Key Features
Interactive Chat: Provides real-time responses to user queries.

Cybersecurity Knowledge: Answers questions about passwords, phishing, and safe browsing with detailed information.

User Feedback: Adjusts the flow of conversation based on user satisfaction.

Multimedia Integration: Includes visual ASCII art and an audio greeting for a unique experience.
